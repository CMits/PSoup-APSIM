# ----------------------- OVERVIEW -----------------------

**Goal:** connect quantitative APSIM outputs with qualitative PSoup outputs in a **robust, auditable** way.

**High-level flow**
1) **APSIM** produces **S/D (Supply/Demand)** per environment/year.
2) We map S/D to **SUC (0..2)** ‚Äî the sucrose knob used by **PSoup**.
3) **PSoup** returns **Sustained Growth (SG)**. We **do not trust magnitudes**, only **direction** when sucrose is added:
   - ‚Äúmutant + sucrose‚Äù vs ‚Äúmutant‚Äù ‚Üí **Higher / Same / Lower**.
4) We translate this **direction** into **APSIM TTN (tillers)**, using the **environment bounds** learned from APSIM:
   - **Scheme A:** place a fraction **z** inside the [TTN_low, TTN_high] interval.
   - **Scheme B:** snap to **cultivar lines** (Low / Medium / High) from literature (Alam et al., 2014).

Everything you see in the calculator and batch pages is a concrete implementation of these steps.

# ----------------------- STEP 1 -----------------------
with tabs[1]:
    st.header("Step 1: Map S/D ‚Üí SUC (0..2)")
    st.markdown("""
**Why:** PSoup expects a sucrose input (SUC). APSIM gives S/D. We need a monotone, bounded mapping.

### Linear rule (default)
- Simple, transparent, and easy to explain.
- Example with L=0, U=50, out_min=0, out_max=2:
  - x=0  ‚Üí SUC=0
  - x=25 ‚Üí SUC=1
  - x=50 ‚Üí SUC=2

### Smooth (tanh) rule (optional)
- Same limits (‚âà0..2), smoother around the anchor `center`, `k` controls steepness.
- Useful when S/D is noisy and you want less jumpy SUC near the WT anchor.

**In the Excel batch page:** the **global median S/D** of the upload can be used as the tanh anchor `center` to stay robust across years.

# ----------------------- STEP 2 -----------------------
with tabs[2]:
    st.header("Step 2: PSoup decision (direction only)")
    st.markdown("""
**Why:** We only trust the **sign** of the change in PSoup's Sustained Growth (SG), not its magnitude.

For each row (same genotype, same environment):
- `œÑ` (tau) is a small tolerance to suppress numerical noise (e.g., 0.001 or 1% of baseline).

**Replicates (optional):**
If you have multiple PSoup comparisons:
We still make a **directional** decision (majority), but `p` can be used (optionally) to fine-tune placement in Scheme A.

# ----------------------- STEP 3 -----------------------
with tabs[3]:
    st.header("Step 3: Environment envelopes for TTN (from APSIM)")
    st.markdown("""
**Why:** Tillering capacity depends on environment. We use APSIM-based lines to define plausible TTN bounds as a
function of S/D (x).

**Envelope extremes (Very low / Very high branching):**

**Intermediate cultivar lines (Alam et al., 2014):**
| Branching cultivar | Intercept | Slope |
|---|---:|---:|
| Very low  | -1.363 | 0.159 |
| Low       | -0.818 | 0.206 |
| Medium    | -0.265 | 0.247 |
| High      | +0.329 | 0.300 |
| Very high | +0.960 | 0.347 |

These are near-parallel, so a single fraction **z** describes how far you sit between **TTN_low(x)** and **TTN_high(x)**.

Map the label directly to a line (editable in the app):

**You can upload an .xlsx with a sheet like this (headers are case-sensitive):**

Required (S/D):

Required (PSoup SG):
- `SG_mut`       ‚Üí PSoup Sustained Growth (mutant, no sucrose)
- `SG_mut_SUC`   ‚Üí PSoup Sustained Growth (mutant + sucrose)

Optional (recommended):
- `h`, `l`       ‚Üí replicate counts of Higher/Lower (direction only)
- `Date`         ‚Üí e.g. `15/01/2007` (day-first), used to derive `Year`
- `Years`        ‚Üí e.g. `2007-01-15` (ISO), used if `Date` is missing
- `Genotype`     ‚Üí label for your own reference (not required by the app)

The batch page:
1) Computes **Label** using the tolerance `œÑ`.
2) Builds **TTN_low/TTN_high** from S/D (or uses a global range).
3) Applies **Scheme A (z)** or **Scheme B (cultivar lines)** to get **TTN_pred**.
4) Shows per-year plots and lets you download the rows and parameters.

# ----------------------- ASSUMPTIONS & QA -----------------------
with tabs[7]:
    st.header("Assumptions, limitations, QA")
    st.markdown("""
**Assumptions**
- **Monotonicity:** More favorable PSoup direction (Higher) never reduces TTN relative to Same/Lower.
- **Direction-only:** We do not use SG magnitudes; only the sign of change matters.
- **Envelope validity:** APSIM lines approximate min/max tillering for a given S/D; cultivar lines sit between them.
- **Noise tolerance:** A small `œÑ` avoids classifying tiny numerical wiggles as real changes.

**When to use which scheme**
- **Scheme A** (z inside envelope): smooth, adjustable spacing; great for sensitivity and presentation.
- **Scheme B** (cultivar lines): ties predictions to published branching levels; excellent for defensibility.

**Quality checks you can run**
- Verify that for any fixed environment `x`, the order **Lower < Same < Higher** holds in TTN.
- Sensitivity to `z` choices (Scheme A): try 0.30/0.50/0.70 vs 0.35/0.50/0.65; results should shift sensibly.
- If using the tanh SDR‚ÜíSUC map in Step 1, check that the chosen `center` is reasonable (e.g., global median S/D).
- If clamping to [0,6], confirm that the envelope is clipped consistently across years.

**Limitations**
- Without real TTN observations for calibration, the absolute positions within the envelope (or the chosen cultivar line)
  are **assumptions**. We surface and document those assumptions explicitly to keep the workflow auditable.
